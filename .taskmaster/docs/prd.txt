## 2. Product overview

### 2.1 Problem statement

Current movie tracking platforms like Letterboxd, IMDb, and others focus primarily on individual user experiences. They lack robust collaborative features that allow couples, friends, and groups to jointly manage what they want to watch together. This creates friction in shared entertainment decisions and limits the social aspect of movie and TV show discovery.

CineCollab is a web application that enables users to create, manage, and collaborate on movie and TV show watchlists. The platform combines personal list management with seamless collaborative features, allowing multiple users to contribute to shared lists through simple invitation links.

### 2.3 Product vision

To become the go-to platform for collaborative entertainment planning, making it effortless for people to discover, organize, and track movies and shows together.

### 2.4 Key differentiators

- **True collaboration:** Real-time collaborative list editing with conflict resolution
- **Seamless sharing:** One-click invitation links for instant collaboration
- **Unified experience:** Both personal and collaborative lists in one platform
- **Social tracking:** See who added what and when items were watched
- **Public sharing:** Generate shareable links for recommendations
